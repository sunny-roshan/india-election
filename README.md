# How did India vote in 2024?

The New York Times and The Economist published interactive maps visualising the results of the 2024 US Presidential election, showing county-level vote swings from 2020 to 2024.  

I looked at their analysis and thought: _why have I never seen any interactive maps of Indian political behaviour?_ Finding nothing online, I decided to replicate their analysis for the 2024 Indian parliamentary election.

### Give me the tl;dr
Play around with [***this***](https://indian-elections.netlify.app/nda_vote_swing.html) map I made showing how the ruling coalition's vote share evolved between 2019 and 2024.
